This reduces code duplication and promotes modular design, where components can be easily swapped or extended.\n","Flexibility and Extensibility: Polymorphism enables the addition of new classes or types without requiring modifications to existing code that interacts with the common interface. This makes systems more adaptable to change and easier to extend with new functionalities.\n","Simplified Code Management: By allowing different objects to share the same interface, polymorphism simplifies the management of complex systems. Developers can focus on the common behavior defined by the interface rather than dealing with specific implementations of each object type.\n","Dynamic Method Dispatch: Polymorphism facilitates dynamic method dispatch, where the specific method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. This allows for more dynamic and flexible program behavior.\n","Abstraction and Encapsulation: It supports abstraction by allowing developers to interact with objects through a common interface, hiding the underlying implementation details. This, in turn, enhances encapsulation, as the internal workings of each object are protected.\n","In essence, polymorphism is fundamental to achieving true object-oriented design, fostering code that is more robust, maintainable, and adaptable to evolving requirements.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zVxSIJZSSvbX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q.15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n","An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is intended to be subclassed.

Its main significance is that it allows the programmer to define cleanup actions such as releasing external resources (e.g., closing files, network connections) before the object is reclaimed by memory.
